1. now need presentation business logic to add new montly budget for this month
- lets create a use case to add new budget
- we need new value
- who should create the value?
- maybe use case can create the value
- and bloc would pass it extreme monents and amount?
    - becasue in get home balances, cubit also passes extreme moments, so lets keep it consistent
- and use case would provide period for month


- so we would call this use case?
- createMonthDailyBudget
- accept extremen monents 
- accept amount
